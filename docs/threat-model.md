# Threat Model (STRIDE)

A systematic STRIDE threat model for `claude_openai_mcp_connector`. It
complements [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) (narrative threat model + Reusable
Security Baseline mapping) by organizing threats along the STRIDE categories and
mapping each to the in-code invariant (`INV-n`) and test that pins it. Known gaps
are tracked in [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md#security--enterprise-maturity-gaps-not-yet-addressed).

Invariant labels (`INV-1`…`INV-7`) match the `mcp-vault-security` skill and
`CLAUDE.md`.

## 1. Scope & system overview

The server exposes a **private Markdown vault** (`KNOWLEDGE_ROOT`) to MCP clients
over two transports:

- **stdio** — local CLI/desktop clients (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop).
  Full read+write tool surface. Auth is the OS process boundary (the client
  spawns the server).
- **Streamable HTTP** — remote Chat connectors (ChatGPT, Claude.ai web; Claude
  Desktop/Code remote; Claude API). Authenticated, read-only by default,
  optionally with a built-in **OAuth 2.1** authorization server.

The defining constraint: **the code repo is public; the vault is private** and
referenced only via `KNOWLEDGE_ROOT`.

### Primary adversaries
1. **The MCP client / LLM itself** — semi-trusted. Tool arguments are
   attacker-influenced input (path traversal, frontmatter injection, stale
   overwrite). The LLM may also be steered by injected vault content.
2. **A remote network attacker** — on the HTTP path: unauthenticated callers,
   DNS-rebinding, token theft/replay, OAuth flow abuse.
3. **Authored vault content** — web clips / third-party notes carrying prompt
   injection (returned as data).
4. **The repo contributor / CI supply chain** — accidental secret/vault commit,
   workflow poisoning, tag-substitution.

## 2. Assets

| Asset | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Vault note **content** | The private knowledge being protected; confidentiality + integrity. |
| Vault **boundary** (`KNOWLEDGE_ROOT`) | Containment line; nothing outside must be readable/writable. |
| Note **integrity** | Edits must be intentional, non-destructive, non-stale. |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` / OAuth tokens / `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` | Gate remote access; leakage = full read (and maybe write). |
| Frontmatter **metadata** (`id`, `updated_at`) | Server-owned identity/stamps; must not be client-forgeable. |
| The **public repo** | Must never contain vault content, secrets, or real paths. |

## 3. Trust boundaries & data flow

```
                        ┌────────────────────────── public internet ──────────────────────────┐

                                                                          ▼

                                                                          ▼

```

**Trust boundaries crossed:** (a) network → loopback (HTTP auth gate), (b)
client tool args → server (input validation), (c) server → filesystem (path
containment), (d) vault content → LLM/agent (untrusted-data boundary), (e)
repo/CI → public (secret hygiene).

## 4. STRIDE analysis

### S — Spoofing (identity)

| Threat | Mitigation (invariant / code) | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unauthenticated caller hits `/mcp` | Bearer required; fail-closed if `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` unset (`INV-6`, `httpAuth.ts`, `config.ts`). 401 + `WWW-Authenticate`. | Token strength is the operator's responsibility. |
| Web client can't send a static bearer | OAuth 2.1 + PKCE S256 + DCR; login gated by `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` (scrypt) (`INV-7`, `oauth/`). | Shared single-user password (no per-user identity — see gaps: RBAC). |
| Token/timing side-channel on compare | Constant-time compare, length-normalized (`INV-6`, `httpAuth.ts`; `INV-7` PKCE/login). | — |
| DNS-rebinding to reach the loopback server | `enableDnsRebindingProtection` + `allowedHosts`/`allowedOrigins` (`INV-6`, `httpServer.ts`). | Operator must add only the intended tunnel host. |

### T — Tampering (integrity)

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path traversal / encoded traversal / symlink escape to write outside the vault | Multi-phase guard, fail-closed (`INV-1`, `pathSafety.ts`); realpath prefix + symlink-escape checks on every write path (`knowledgeStore.ts`). | New write paths must route through the guard (enforced by review + tests). |
| Destructive or **stale** overwrite of an existing note | Two-step `plan`→`apply` with SHA-256 staleness check; reject if changed (`INV-3`). | A within-window concurrent edit is detected, not merged. |
| Overwriting a file via "create" | `flag: "wx"` — never overwrites (`INV-3`). | — |
| Forging server-owned frontmatter (`id`, `updated_at`) or injecting arbitrary YAML keys/types | Field **allowlist** + value-type checks (`INV-2`, `frontmatter.ts`). | Allowlist widening requires threat review + tests. |
| Request body abuse | Body-size cap → 413 (`INV-6`). | — |

### R — Repudiation (auditability)

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Who searched / fetched / wrote what?" cannot be reconstructed | Startup line logs only host:port + write flag; **secrets/content never logged** (`INV-6`). | ⚠️ **No audit log today.** This is a known gap — see ROADMAP (audit log, OpenTelemetry). For multi-user/enterprise this is required. |

### I — Information disclosure (confidentiality)

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading files outside the vault | Path containment, fail-closed (`INV-1`). | — |
| Serving the vault over HTTP with no auth | `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` required or startup refused; loopback bind by default (`INV-6`). | Public exposure only via explicit HTTPS tunnel. |
| Token/code/password leaking via logs | No secrets in logs; secrets via env only (`INV-6`, `INV-7`, `INV-4`). | — |
| Over-broad remote capability | Read-only by default; write tools are **not even registered** without `allowWrite` + `vault.write` scope (`INV-6`, `INV-7`). | — |
| OAuth open-redirect leaking a code | `redirect_uri` exact-match + https/loopback only; bad client/redirect → 400, not redirected (`INV-7`). | — |
| Secret/vault committed to the public repo | `.gitignore` + synthetic-only fixtures + per-file `git add` (`INV-4`). | ⚠️ Relies on discipline; **harder secret-scanning is a gap** (ROADMAP). |
| Exfiltration of vault content by an authorized-but-malicious client | — | ⚠️ **No DLP / exfiltration detection** (known gap, ROADMAP). Out of scope for 0.1.0. |

### D — Denial of service

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Symlink cycle causing unbounded recursion | `walkMarkdownFiles` tracks visited realpaths; cycle terminates (`INV-1`, guard #8). | — |
| Unbounded OAuth client/token minting (memory exhaustion) | Capped + pruned collections; DCR input limits (`INV-7`). | In-memory store; a restart clears state (and forces re-auth — see operations.md). |
| Oversized request body | Body cap → 413 (`INV-6`). | No global rate limiting beyond the coarse OAuth-endpoint limiter. |

### E — Elevation of privilege

| Threat | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-scoped web token performing writes | Session registers write tools only when `allowWrite && token has vault.write`; otherwise undiscoverable (`INV-7`, `INV-6`). | — |
| Authorization-code replay / injection | Codes are single-use, short-TTL, CSPRNG, bound to client/redirect/PKCE challenge (`INV-7`). | — |
| `plain` PKCE downgrade | S256 only; `plain` rejected (`INV-7`, `pkce.ts`). | — |
| Reading arbitrary files via a crafted `patch_id` | `patch_id` validated as UUID; patch path constrained (`INV-3`). | — |
| Prompt injection in vault content steering the agent into unsafe actions | Server `instructions` declare returned content is **data, not commands** (`INV-5`); the server returns content faithfully and does not execute it. | ⚠️ Defense depends on the **client/agent** honoring the boundary; the server cannot enforce downstream behavior. |
| Compromise of the server process escaping to the host | Loopback bind, least-privilege env; **systemd sandbox hardening documented** (operations.md §"Sandbox hardening" — `ProtectHome`/`ProtectSystem=strict`/empty `CapabilityBoundingSet`/`SystemCallFilter=@system-service`/`MemoryDenyWriteExecute`) = layer 1. | ⚠️ Hardening is **operator-applied** (a drop-in, not enforced by the code); bwrap (layer 3) still a gap. Reduced from "limited isolation". |

## 5. Assurance

Security behaviors are **pinned by tests** (`pnpm test`, vitest), not just by
convention — see `tests/pathSafety.test.ts`, `tests/knowledgeStore.test.ts`,
`tests/httpServer.test.ts`, `tests/oauth.test.ts`. Coverage includes path
traversal (raw/encoded/malformed/absolute/`~`/NUL/over-length), symlink escape +
cycle, frontmatter allowlist + value-type rejection, two-step stale reject,
overwrite collision, HTTP 401/read-only tool surface, and the full OAuth flow
(PKCE match/mismatch, single-use codes, redirect policy, refresh rotation,
audience-bound `/mcp`).

Supply chain: GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned, workflows run least-privilege
(`contents: read`, per-job elevation), CODEOWNERS gates `.github/`, Dependabot +
CodeQL are enabled.

## 6. Known gaps & residual risk

These are **not** mitigated in v0.1.0 and are tracked in
[`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md#security--enterprise-maturity-gaps-not-yet-addressed):

- **No third-party penetration test** — self/AI review only.
- **No audit log** (Repudiation) — and no OpenTelemetry/structured events.
- **Single-user; no RBAC** (Spoofing/EoP at the team level).
- **No DLP / exfiltration detection** (Information disclosure by an authorized
  client).
- **Sandbox isolation** of the server process (EoP after compromise): layer 1
  (systemd hardening) is now **documented** in operations.md but is
  operator-applied, not code-enforced; bwrap (layer 3) is still a gap.
- **Secret hygiene relies on discipline** — hardened secret scanning / signed
  release artifacts not yet in place.

Suggested sequencing (from ROADMAP): formalize this threat model → add a
content-free **audit log** → commission a **third-party pen test**; treat RBAC /
DLP / sandboxing as larger bets gated on validated team-adoption demand.
