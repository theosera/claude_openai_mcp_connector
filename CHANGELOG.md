# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Community-health files** for public contribution: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  (dev setup, the `pnpm test` quality gate, commit/branch conventions, and the
  "security reports go through SECURITY.md, not issues" rule), a Contributor
  Covenant `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, GitHub issue forms
  (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` / `feature_request.yml` /
  `config.yml`, with blank issues disabled and a security-report contact link),
  and a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` mirroring the CI quality gate.
- **Actionable private security-reporting channel**: `SECURITY.md` and the issue
  template's security link now point to GitHub private vulnerability reporting
  (draft advisory) instead of only naming the maintainer, so reporters have a
  usable private intake.

### Fixed

- **A single document with unparseable frontmatter no longer breaks every
  query.** `search_documents` / `list_projects` / `fetch_document` /
  `trace_sources` walk and parse every note, so one file with malformed YAML/JSON
  frontmatter (a bare-dash value, or raw control characters that leak in from a
  web clipping) made gray-matter throw and abort the whole operation
  non-deterministically. The read path now parses frontmatter fault-tolerantly
  (`parseMarkdownSafe`): a note that fails to parse is indexed by its body/path
  with empty metadata and a one-line, content-free stderr note, instead of
  poisoning the batch. Path-containment / symlink guards are unchanged
  (`src/frontmatter.ts`, `src/knowledgeStore.ts`, `tests/knowledgeStore.test.ts`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-05

Second release. The headline change is **multi-root knowledge access**; the rest
is developer-facing hook tooling (session archiving, command-learning logs),
documentation, and dependency/CI maintenance. No breaking changes — a single
`KNOWLEDGE_ROOT` setup behaves exactly as in `0.1.0`.

### Added

- **Multiple knowledge roots** (`KNOWLEDGE_ROOTS="name=/path,…"`): search,
  fetch, list, and trace across several repos at once. The first root is the
  primary (writable); every additional root is strictly read-only and its
  documents are addressed as `name:relative/path` (results carry a `root`
  field). Single `KNOWLEDGE_ROOT` behavior is unchanged. Each root keeps the
  full path-containment guard chain; overlapping roots are rejected at startup
  (`src/multiRootStore.ts`, `tests/multiRootStore.test.ts`).
- **session-archive hook** (`.claude/skills/session-archive/`): Stop/SessionEnd
  hook that renders the full Claude Code session transcript (title +
  conversation + tool calls/results, secrets masked with the ops-logging rules)
  into one Markdown note per session inside the private vault clone and pushes
  it, making session history searchable through this MCP server. The vault is
  located indirectly (`SESSION_VAULT_REPO` env or a `.claude-session-vault`
  marker); no private repo name or path is committed here. No-op without a
  vault clone. Adds a **PreCompact snapshot mode**: before auto-compact prunes
  a transcript, a full-detail snapshot is written under
  `_logs/ClaudeCode-Web/_precompact/` so pre-compact content is never lost.
- **ops-logging skill + hooks** (`.claude/skills/ops-logging/`): PostToolUse/Stop
  hooks that append a "command + intent" learning log (all secrets masked;
  `Bearer <token>` masked as a unit; GitHub MCP calls recorded via a
  metadata-only allowlist) and push it once per session to a separate private
  `terminal-ops-logs` repo. No-op unless `OPS_LOG_REPO` points at a clone.
- **MIT `LICENSE`** file and a `license` field in `package.json`.
- **Manual release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
  `workflow_dispatch` → `gh release create`, refusing to overwrite a
  pre-existing tag.
- **Documentation**: operations guide (`docs/operations.md`, incl. Cloudflare
  account/domain requirements, systemd full-hardening drop-in, and a bwrap
  sandbox recipe for the stdio server), `docs/ROADMAP.md`, a STRIDE
  `docs/threat-model.md`, bilingual PR/FAQ (`docs/PRFAQ.md`, `docs/PRFAQ.en.md`),
  and README polish (architecture Mermaid diagram, status badges, use-cases).

### Changed

- `KnowledgeStore` is now composed behind a multi-root layer; `search`,
  `chatgpt` aliases, `config`, and result `types` were adapted to carry an
  optional `root` and to resolve `name:relative/path` addresses.
- Dependency maintenance (dev toolchain): `@types/node` → `^26`, `eslint`
  → `^10.6`, `oxlint` → `^1.71`, `prettier` → `^3.9`, `typescript-eslint`
  → `^8.62`, `vite` → `^8.1`, `vitest` → `^4.1.9`, plus a `github-actions`
  group bump. `CLAUDE.global.md` re-synced byte-identical with the canonical
  global layer.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-09

First tagged release. MCP server exposing a private Markdown vault
(`KNOWLEDGE_ROOT`) over two transports:

### Added

- Add oxlint as a fast correctness pre-pass before ESLint, typecheck, build, and tests.

- **stdio transport** for local CLI/desktop clients (Claude Code, Codex, Claude
  Desktop) with the full tool surface.
- **Streamable HTTP transport** for remote Chat connectors, hardened with bearer
  auth (constant-time, fail-closed), loopback bind, DNS-rebinding protection,
  request-body cap, and a read-only tool surface unless `MCP_HTTP_ALLOW_WRITE=1`.
- **OAuth 2.1 authorization server** (opt-in) for ChatGPT / Claude.ai web:
  metadata discovery, dynamic client registration, PKCE S256, authorization-code
  + refresh-token grants, scrypt login gate, scope enforcement
  (`vault.read` / `vault.write`), RFC 8707 audience binding, and consent-page
  clickjacking headers.
- Coarse per-client **rate limiting** on the public OAuth endpoints
  (`/authorize`, `/register`), and **ESLint + Prettier** with `lint` / `format` /
  `format:check` scripts wired into CI.
- Search **parse cache** (mtime/size-invalidated) in `KnowledgeStore` so queries
  no longer re-parse unchanged Markdown files on every call.
- Tools: `search_documents`, `fetch_document`, `list_projects`, `trace_sources`,
  `create_document`, `plan_document_update` → `apply_planned_update` (two-step,
  stale-safe writes), and ChatGPT-compatible `search` / `fetch` aliases.
- Security invariants pinned by tests: path containment, symlink-escape/cycle,
  frontmatter allowlist, two-step stale-safe writes, HTTP auth + read-only
  surface, and the full OAuth flow.
